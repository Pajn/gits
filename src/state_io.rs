//! Shared helpers for durably persisting Kindra's on-disk operation state and
//! serializing concurrent `kin` invocations against each other.
//!
//! Two hazards motivate this module:
//!
//! 1. A crash (or full disk) partway through rewriting a state file used to leave
//!    behind a truncated, unparseable JSON document. Every later command then
//!    treated the corrupt file as an active operation and refused to run, and even
//!    `kin abort` could not recover because it also parses the file. [`write_atomic`]
//!    writes to a sibling temp file, fsyncs it, and renames it into place so readers
//!    only ever observe a complete document.
//! 2. Two `kin` processes running concurrently in the same repository could both
//!    pass the "is an operation already in progress?" check and then clobber each
//!    other's state file. [`RepoLock`] takes a whole-repository advisory lock so the
//!    second process fails fast with a clear message instead.
