## Core Concepts

Kindra is built around the idea of a **stack** of branches. A stack is a linear sequence of branches where each branch builds on top of the previous one, ultimately originating from a "base" branch (like `main` or `master`).

Kindra automatically identifies your stack by looking for local branches that are descendants of the merge base between your current branch and the base branch.

---

## Command Reference

### `absorb`

**Description:** Automatically distributes your staged changes into the commits of the current branch that introduced the touched lines (powered by the [git-absorb](https://github.com/tummychow/git-absorb) engine), folds the generated `fixup!` commits with an autosquash rebase, and rebases descendant branches in the same pass — so an absorb never sets the stack adrift.

**Usage:**

```bash
kin absorb [options]
```

- `-n, --dry-run`: Show which commits the staged changes would be absorbed into without changing anything.
- `-b, --base <ref>`: Absorb into commits above this base instead of the stack parent. Must be a commit on the current branch, at or above the stack parent.
- `--force-author`: Generate fixups to commits not made by you.
- `-w, --whole-file`: Match changes against the complete file instead of individual hunks.
- `-F, --one-fixup-per-commit`: Only generate one fixup per target commit.
- `-s, --squash`: Create `squash!` commits instead of `fixup!` commits. Their combined commit messages are accepted as-is (no editor opens during the fold).
- `-m, --message <body>`: Commit message body given to all fixup commits.
- `-v, --verbose`: Display more output from the absorb engine.
- `--force`: Skip the checked-out-in-another-worktree safety check for affected branches.

The absorb range is scoped to the current branch's own commits: everything below the branch's stack parent (or the merge base for a stack root) is out of range, so a fixup can never target another branch's commit. The engine also honours your existing `absorb.*` git config (for example `absorb.autoStageIfNothingStaged` and `absorb.oneFixupPerCommit`).

Changes the engine cannot place — unabsorbable hunks, unstaged edits, untracked files — are always set aside for the rebases and restored when the operation completes (including through a conflict stop resolved with `kin continue`); previously staged hunks come back staged. Because everything is set aside up front, `absorb` takes no `--autostash` flag.

The whole operation is undoable with `kin undo`, and `kin abort` after a conflict stop restores the pre-absorb branch tips with the absorbed content back as staged changes — nothing is lost either way. A branch that forks from a commit inside the absorbed range (one no branch points at) cannot follow the rewrite, so absorb refuses up front rather than stranding it.

**When to use it:** Use this instead of the standalone `git absorb` when working in a stack. Running plain `git absorb --and-rebase` rewrites the current branch without moving its descendants, leaving the stack floating (recoverable with `kin restack`). `kin absorb` performs the same absorb but keeps the stack intact in one pass.

**ASCII-Art Visualization:**

```text
Before absorb on 'feature-A' (staged fix belongs in A1):
main -> [A1] -> [A2] -> (feature-A) -> [B1] -> (feature-B)

$ kin absorb

After kin absorb:
main -> [A1'] -> [A2'] -> (feature-A) -> [B1'] -> (feature-B)
```

*(The staged change is folded into `A1`, and `feature-B` follows the rewritten history automatically.)*

---

### `commit`

**Description:** Commits changes and automatically rebases descendant branches in the affected stack in a single pass using `--update-refs` (Requires Git >= 2.38.0).

**Usage:**

```bash
kin commit [git-commit-args]
kin commit --on [<branch>] [git-commit-args]
kin commit -b [<name>] [--insert] [git-commit-args]
kin commit --interactive [git-commit-args]
kin commit --fixup <sha> [git-commit-args]
```

Any arguments you pass to `kin commit` (e.g., `-m "my message"`) are passed directly to `git commit`. This forwarding is the same for plain, `--interactive`, and `--fixup` invocations, and includes pathspecs after `--`.

- `--on <branch>`: Commit onto another branch instead of the current one. The next token is consumed as the branch name.
- `--on=`: Open an interactive branch picker for the current stack.
- `--on`: Open the interactive branch picker only when `--on` is the final token.
- `-b, --new-branch [name]`: Create a new branch forked from the current commit and commit onto it (the `git checkout -b <name> && git commit` shortcut). The name is optional: if omitted, it is derived by slugifying the commit-message subject, so a message must be supplied inline (e.g. `-m`) in that case. The derived name is deduped against existing branches (`fix-parser`, `fix-parser-2`, …). Ends on the new branch. Mutually exclusive with `--on`, `--interactive`, and `--fixup`. Accepts `--new-branch=<name>`.
- `--insert`: With `-b`, splice the new branch *into* the stack instead of forking a sibling: after the commit, the current branch's children are restacked onto the new branch, forming `current -> new -> children`. Requires `-b`. Without it, `-b` leaves existing children in place.
- `--interactive`: Open an interactive commit picker showing all commits in the stack. Squashes the staged changes into the selected commit.
- `--fixup <sha>`: Non-interactive equivalent of `--interactive`, targeting a specific commit. Squashes the staged changes into the given commit (which must be in the current stack) and rebases the dependent branches. Accepts `--fixup=<sha>` as well. Mutually exclusive with `--interactive` and `--on`.
- `--autostash`: Allow the descendant rebase phase to use Git autostash.
- `--no-autostash`: Disable Git autostash even if configured globally or for the repo.

**Interactive mode behavior:**

When using `--interactive`:
- All commits across the stack are enumerated with their position (e.g., `feature-a 2/3`)
- Whichever commit you select, the staged changes are squashed into it and the dependent branches are rebased — the same behavior for every commit, from anywhere in the stack
- Conflicts during the rebase enter the continue/abort workflow

Interactive examples (`--interactive`):
- `kin commit --interactive` (stage your changes first, then pick the commit to squash them into)
- `kin commit --interactive -- a3.txt`

Non-interactive fixup example (`--fixup`, not part of the interactive behavior above):
- `kin commit --fixup a1b2c3d` (stage your changes first, then squash them into commit `a1b2c3d`)

New-branch examples (`-b` / `--new-branch`):
- `kin commit -b feature-x -m "start feature x"` (fork `feature-x` off the current commit and commit onto it)
- `kin commit -b -m "Add null-deref guard"` (derive the branch name `add-null-deref-guard` from the subject)
- `kin commit -b refactor --insert -m "extract helper"` (create `refactor` and splice it below the current branch's children, restacking them onto it)

Parser behavior:
- `kin commit --on feature-a -m "msg"`: valid (`feature-a` is the target branch).
- `kin commit --on -m "msg"`: invalid, because `--on` expects a branch unless used as the final token.
- Use `kin commit --on= -m "msg"` (or `kin commit --on` as the last token) for interactive selection.

When committing onto another branch, Kindra sets your non-staged files aside, commits the staged changes on the target branch, rebases dependents (unless you choose not to for an external stack), and restores the working tree when it finishes.

How it gets the commit there depends on where the target is:

- **A branch below you in the stack** (the common case): no branch switch at all. The commit is made where you are and replayed onto the target, moving that branch and everything stacked above it in one pass. You stay on your branch throughout.
- **Any other branch** (a sibling stack, the trunk, or an `--amend` of the target's tip): Kindra switches to it, carrying the staged changes along, and returns you to your original branch afterwards, unstaging as it goes.

Either way the staged changes travel by merge, not by copy, so a file that the target branch also changed is no obstacle. Only a genuine conflict between your staged changes and the target stops the operation: below you in the stack it stops as a paused rebase to resolve and `kin continue`; elsewhere it unwinds and leaves you exactly where you started.

**When to use it:** Use this instead of `git commit` when you are working on a branch that has other branches building on top of it. It saves you from having to manually rebase each dependent branch.

**ASCII-Art Visualization:**

```text
Before commit on 'feature-A':
main -> [A1] -> (feature-A) -> [B1] -> (feature-B) -> [C1] -> (feature-C)

$ kin commit -m "update A"

After kin commit:
main -> [A1] -> [A2] -> (feature-A) -> [B1'] -> (feature-B) -> [C1'] -> (feature-C)
```

*(All descendant branches `feature-B` and `feature-C` are updated automatically.)*

```text
Inserting a branch on 'feature-A' with --insert:
main -> [A1] -> (feature-A) -> [B1] -> (feature-B)

$ kin commit -b refactor --insert -m "extract helper"

After kin commit -b --insert:
main -> [A1] -> (feature-A) -> [R1] -> (refactor) -> [B1'] -> (feature-B)
```

*(Without `--insert`, `refactor` would instead fork as a sibling off `feature-A` and `feature-B` would stay put.)*

---

### `move`

**Description:** Moves the current branch and all its descendants onto a new target branch in a single pass using `--update-refs` (Requires Git >= 2.38.0).

**Usage:**

```bash
kin move [--onto <target>] [--all] [--autostash|--no-autostash]
```

- `--onto <target>`: The branch to move the current stack onto.
- `--all`: If no target is specified, list all local branches to choose from (instead of just branches in the current stack).
- `--autostash`: Allow the rebase loop to use Git autostash.
- `--no-autostash`: Disable Git autostash even if configured globally or for the repo.

**When to use it:** Use this when you want to relocate a whole set of changes to a new base branch (e.g., moving a feature stack from `develop` to `main`).

**ASCII-Art Visualization:**

```text
Before moving 'feature-A' onto 'main':
main -> [M1]
      \-> [D1] -> (develop) -> [A1] -> (feature-A) -> [B1] -> (feature-B)

$ kin move --onto main

After kin move:
main -> [M1] -> [A1'] -> (feature-A) -> [B1'] -> (feature-B)
      \-> [D1] -> (develop)
```

---

### `rename`

**Description:** Renames a branch. Because Kindra derives stack relationships from commit topology rather than a stored parent map, renaming a branch preserves the entire stack automatically — descendants keep building on the same commits.

**Usage:**

```bash
kin rename <new-name>
kin rename <old-branch> <new-name>
```

- With a single argument, the **current** branch is renamed to `<new-name>`.
- With two arguments, `<old-branch>` is renamed to `<new-name>` (mirrors `git branch -m <old> <new>`).

**What it does:**

- Runs `git branch -m`, so the branch's tracking configuration (`branch.<name>.*`) moves with it (and Git repoints any worktree checked out on the branch).
- Leaves stack parent/child relationships untouched, since they are computed from commit history.

**Restrictions:**

- Refuses to rename the resolved upstream/base branch (e.g. `main`), because the stack is derived relative to it and `.git/kindra.toml` may pin it by name.
- Refuses to overwrite an existing branch.

**When to use it:** Use this to give a branch a better name without breaking the branches stacked on top of it. Renaming with plain `git branch -m` also works, but `kin rename` additionally guards against renaming the base branch and refuses while an operation is in progress.

---

### `reorder`

**Description:** Opens an editor so you can rewrite branch parent relationships for the current stack component, including forked stacks.

**Usage:**

```bash
kin reorder [--force] [--autostash|--no-autostash]
```

- `--force`: Continue even if a branch that needs rebasing is checked out in another worktree.
- `--autostash`: Allow the reorder rebase loop to use Git autostash.
- `--no-autostash`: Disable Git autostash even if configured globally or for the repo.

**Editor format:**

```text
branch feature-c parent main
branch feature-a
branch feature-b
```

- `branch <name> parent <parent>` sets an explicit parent.
- `branch <name>` means the branch listed immediately above becomes the parent.
- The first row must keep an explicit parent because there is no row above it.
- Forks are created by assigning the same explicit parent to multiple branches.

**What it does:**

- Loads the current connected stack component around your checked-out branch.
- Opens a temp file listing each branch and its current parent.
- Validates the edited graph: every branch must appear once, parents must be valid, cycles are rejected, and the result must stay connected to the upstream.
- Rebases branches in dependency order and restores your original checkout at the end.

**Recovery:**

- If a reorder started by Kindra stops on conflicts, resolve them and run `kin continue`.
- To abandon an in-progress reorder and restore the saved state, run `kin abort`.
- If you are in a plain native Git rebase with no saved Kindra state, use `git rebase --continue` or `git rebase --abort`.

**When to use it:** Use this when `move` is too narrow and you want to freely reshape a stack, such as rotating a linear stack, moving a branch across a fork, or turning a linear stack into siblings.

---

### `sync`

**Description:** Rebases the current stack onto the resolved upstream branch in a single rebase using `--update-refs` and automatically cleans up merged branches.

**Usage:**

```bash
kin sync [--force] [--no-delete] [--autostash|--no-autostash]
```

**Arguments:**
- `--force`: Force the sync even if branches in the stack are checked out in other worktrees.
- `--no-delete`: Do not automatically delete branches that have already been integrated into the upstream branch.
- `--autostash`: Allow the sync rebase to use Git autostash.
- `--no-autostash`: Disable Git autostash even if configured globally or for the repo.

**What it does:**

- Finds the resolved upstream/base branch using `find_upstream()` logic. This detection covers `.git/kindra.toml`, `init.defaultBranch`, common names like `main`/`master`/`trunk`, and remote-qualified bases.
- Finds the top branch in your current stack.
- Detects the first commit that still needs replaying (while handling lower PRs already landed via merge, rebase/cherry-pick, or squash).
- Checks out the top branch and runs one `git rebase --update-refs --onto <upstream> <old-base> <top>`.
- **Automatically deletes local branches** in the stack that are already merged into the upstream branch (unless `--no-delete` is used).
- If your current branch is deleted because it was merged, Kindra automatically switches you to the upstream branch.

**When to use it:** Use this after one or more lower PRs in your stack have already landed on the upstream branch, and you want to sync all remaining branches and clean up the merged ones in one pass.

**Conflict handling:** If a sync started by Kindra conflicts, resolve it and run `kin continue`, or abandon it with `kin abort`. If you are in a plain native Git rebase with no saved Kindra state, use `git rebase --continue` or `git rebase --abort`.

---

### `restack`

**Description:** Automatically identifies and repairs "floating" branches that were based on an old version of the current branch (e.g., after an `amend` or `rebase`).

**Usage:**

```bash
kin restack [--history-limit <n>] [--autostash|--no-autostash] [--pick]
```

**What it does:**
- Scans all local branches for those whose history includes a commit that "matches" the current `HEAD` but is not part of the current branch's ancestry. Patch-id fallback is limited to the current branch's private lineage so unrelated branches that only share upstream-equivalent patches are ignored.
- These branches are considered "floating" because they are pointing to a commit that has been replaced.
- `kin restack` will automatically rebase these floating branches onto the new `HEAD`.

**Arguments:**
- `--history-limit <n>`: Maximum first-parent history depth to scan while detecting floating branches. `0` disables the limit and scans the full history.
- `--autostash`: Allow the rebase loop to use Git autostash.
- `--no-autostash`: Disable Git autostash even if configured globally or for the repo.
- `--pick`: Show an interactive picker to select which branches to restack. Requires an interactive terminal. If no branches are selected, the command exits without performing any rebases.

**History limit resolution order:**
- CLI override: `--history-limit <n>`
- Repository config: `.git/kindra.toml`
- Global config: the standard platform config directory as `kindra/config.toml`
- Default: `100`

Example config:

```toml
[restack]
history_limit = 250
```

**Rebase autostash resolution order:**
- CLI override: `--autostash` or `--no-autostash`
- Repository config: `.git/kindra.toml`
- Global config: the standard platform config directory as `kindra/config.toml`
- Default: `false`

Example config:

```toml
[rebase]
autostash = true
```

**When to use it:** Use this after you've amended a commit or rebased a branch that has other branches building on top of it. Instead of manually rebasing each dependent branch, `kin restack` will find and fix them for you.

**ASCII-Art Visualization:**

```text
Before 'amend' on 'feature-A':
main -> [A1] -> (feature-A) -> [B1] -> (feature-B)

$ git commit --amend -m "A modified"

After 'amend' (feature-B is now floating on old A1):
main -> [A1'] -> (feature-A)
      \-> [A1] -> [B1] -> (feature-B)

$ kin restack

After kin restack:
main -> [A1'] -> (feature-A) -> [B1'] -> (feature-B)
```

---

### `checkout` (alias `co`)

**Description:** Provides an interactive interface to navigate branches in the stack.

**Usage:**

```bash
kin checkout [--all]
kin checkout [subcommand]
```

- `kin co`: Opens an interactive selection menu for branches in the current stack.
- `kin co --all`: Opens an interactive selection menu for all local branches.
- `kin co up`: Checkout the branch immediately "above" the current one in the stack.
- `kin co down`: Checkout the branch immediately "below" the current one in the stack.
- `kin co top`: Checkout the branch at the very top of the current stack.

**When to use it:** Use this for fast, ergonomic navigation without needing to remember branch names.

---

### `worktree` (alias `wt`)

**Description:** Manages Git worktrees for trunk, review, disposable branch work, and durable per-branch checkouts.

**Usage:**

```bash
kin worktree
kin wt list
kin wt main
kin wt review [<branch>] [--force]
kin wt temp [<branch>]
kin wt temp -b <new-branch> [<start-point>]
kin wt add [<branch>] [--path <path>]
kin wt add -b <new-branch> [<start-point>] [--path <path>]
kin wt path <main|review|branch>
kin wt cd <main|review|branch>
kin wt remove <main|review|branch> [--yes] [--force]
kin wt cleanup [--yes] [--force]
```

With no subcommand, `kin wt` behaves the same as `kin wt list`.

**Roles and the plain-worktree model:**

A worktree's *role* is derived from where it lives, not from any stored record:

- `main`: A persistent worktree pinned to the configured trunk branch.
- `review`: A persistent worktree at a fixed path that can be repointed to different branches.
- `temp`: Disposable branch-specific worktrees, one per branch, auto-cleanable once merged.
- *plain* (`-`): Any other worktree Git knows about — one created by `kin wt add`, by plain `git worktree add`, or the primary working tree. Kindra lists these, resolves them by branch, and removes them on request, but applies no role policy (no pinning, hooks, or auto-cleanup).

Role worktrees live under a managed root (default inside `.git`):

```text
.git/kindra-worktrees/
  main
  review
  temp/<sanitized-branch-name>
```

`kin wt add` instead defaults to a **sibling directory** next to the repository (e.g. `../<repo>-worktrees/<sanitized-branch-name>`); if the repository has no parent directory, it falls back to `<repo>/worktrees/<sanitized-branch-name>`. The location is configurable, `--path` overrides it per-invocation, and if the resolved destination is already claimed by a different branch's worktree, Kindra errors instead of reusing that directory.

For temp and add paths, Kindra sanitizes branch names, so `feature/auth` becomes `feature-auth`. If two branch names would sanitize to the same temp path, `kin wt temp` fails instead of reusing the wrong directory. Likewise, if two branches resolve to the same default `kin wt add` path and one worktree already occupies it, `kin wt add` fails instead of reusing the other branch's directory.

The `kin wt temp` and `kin wt add` synopses have two forms: without `-b`, the optional positional argument is the branch to open (or omitted to use the current branch); with `-b`, it is the start point for the new branch.

**Subcommands:**

- `kin wt list`: Lists every Git worktree with role (`main`/`review`/`temp`/`-`), branch, state, and path — including plain worktrees and the primary working tree.
- `kin wt main`: Ensures the persistent `main` worktree exists and is checked out on the configured trunk branch. If the pinned path exists on some other branch, Kindra errors instead of switching it.
- `kin wt review [<branch>]`: Ensures the reusable `review` worktree exists. If no branch is provided, it uses the current branch. Reusing an existing review worktree on a different branch performs a checkout in place.
- `kin wt review --force <branch>`: Discards local changes in the review worktree before switching branches.
- `kin wt temp [<branch>]`: Ensures a disposable temp worktree exists for the specified branch, or the current branch if omitted.
- `kin wt temp -b <new-branch> [<start-point>]`: Creates a new local branch and checks it out in a temp worktree. If no start point is provided, Kindra uses the current branch.
- `kin wt add [<branch>]`: Creates a durable worktree for the branch (default: current) at the configured default location. If a worktree is already checked out on that branch, its path is returned unchanged (idempotent). If the resolved destination path is already in use by a different branch, Kindra errors instead of reusing it. Unlike `temp`, added worktrees are never auto-cleaned.
- `kin wt add -b <new-branch> [<start-point>]`: Creates a new local branch and a durable worktree for it. On failure — including a failing create hook — the worktree and the newly created branch are rolled back.
- `kin wt add ... --path <path>`: Places the worktree at an explicit path instead of the configured default.
- `kin wt path <target>`: Prints only the resolved path for `main`, `review`, or whichever worktree is checked out on the named branch. Intended for scripts and editor integrations.
- `kin wt cd <target>`: Changes the shell's directory to the resolved worktree — but only with shell integration active (see [`shell-init`](#shell-init)). It prints the path like `kin wt path`; the shell wrapper captures that and runs `cd`. Run directly in a terminal without integration, it prints the path and a note explaining how to enable it.
- `kin wt remove <target>`: Removes a worktree — a role keyword, or a branch name (resolving to whichever worktree is on that branch, whether temp, added, or plain). By default Kindra asks for confirmation; use `--yes` to skip the prompt.
- `kin wt remove --force <target>`: Forces `git worktree remove` when Git would otherwise refuse, such as for a dirty worktree.
- `kin wt cleanup`: Finds temp worktrees whose branch is merged into trunk, prints the candidates, and removes the selected ones. It only ever touches temp worktrees — `main`, `review`, and plain/added worktrees are never auto-removed.

**State reporting:**

`kin wt list` reports a state column using these flags:

- `clean`: No special state applies.
- `current`: This row is the current worktree.
- `dirty`: The worktree has uncommitted changes.
- `merged`: A temp worktree branch has already been merged into trunk and is eligible for cleanup.
- `missing`: Git lists this worktree but its directory no longer exists on disk (run `git worktree prune`).

**Behavior notes:**

- `kin wt review` refuses to discard local changes when switching branches unless you confirm the prompt or pass `--force`.
- `kin wt main` and `kin wt temp` do not retarget an existing live worktree to another branch; they are pinned to their intended branch/path pairing.
- `kin wt add` does not force the checkout: Git refuses to check out a branch already live in another worktree, which keeps the branch → worktree mapping unique.
- `kin wt path` and `kin wt remove` fail if no worktree currently exists for that target.
- Worktree management requires a non-bare repository.

**Shell integration (`kin wt cd`):**

A CLI process cannot change its parent shell's directory, so `kin wt cd` relies on a small wrapper function that captures the path the binary prints and runs `cd` for you. Enable it once in your shell config with the top-level [`kin shell-init`](#shell-init) command. Once loaded, `kin wt cd main`, `kin wt cd review`, and `kin wt cd <branch>` move you into the corresponding worktree.

**Configuration:**

Managed worktrees are configured in `.git/kindra.toml`:

```toml
[worktrees]
root = ".git/kindra-worktrees"
trunk = "main"
# Default location for `kin wt add` ({branch} required; sibling dir by default,
# falling back to <repo>/worktrees when the repo has no parent directory).
add_path_template = "../<repo>-worktrees/{branch}"

[worktrees.hooks]
on_create = []
on_checkout = []
on_remove = []

[worktrees.main]
enabled = true
branch = "main"
path = ".git/kindra-worktrees/main"

[worktrees.review]
enabled = true
path = ".git/kindra-worktrees/review"
reuse = true
clean_before_switch = true

[worktrees.temp]
enabled = true
path_template = ".git/kindra-worktrees/temp/{branch}"
delete_merged = true
```

Configuration notes:

- `worktrees.trunk` defaults to Kindra's resolved upstream branch and falls back to `main` when no better upstream can be found.
- `worktrees.main.branch` defaults to `worktrees.trunk`.
- If `worktrees.trunk` resolves to a remote ref such as `origin/main`, Kindra bootstraps the local main worktree branch from that remote.
- `worktrees.temp.path_template` must include `{branch}` as its final path component; templates like `temp-{branch}` or `temp/{branch}/nested` are rejected.
- `worktrees.add_path_template` sets the default location for `kin wt add`. It must include `{branch}` and — unlike the role paths — is *not* required to live under `worktrees.root`, since added worktrees are meant to live outside the managed root. It defaults to `../<repo>-worktrees/{branch}`, or `<repo>/worktrees/{branch}` when the repository has no parent directory.
- `worktrees.review.clean_before_switch = false` skips Kindra's dirty-worktree cleanup prompt and lets plain `git checkout` decide whether the switch is possible.
- `worktrees.review.reuse = false` and `worktrees.main.allow_branch_switch = true` are not supported in the current implementation.
- Hook commands run in the target worktree directory, and a failing hook aborts the action (rolling back a create). Role worktrees run the global `worktrees.hooks` plus their role-specific hooks; `kin wt add` runs only the global `worktrees.hooks` (added worktrees have no role).

**When to use it:** Use this when you want stable, scriptable worktree locations for trunk and review, disposable branch worktrees Kindra can clean up safely, or durable sibling worktrees for branches you want to keep checked out.

---

### `shell-init`

**Description:** Prints a shell snippet that enables Kindra's shell integration: **completions plus the `kin wt cd` wrapper**, so a single line in your shell config sets up both. It is a top-level command (not under `wt`) so future integration can be folded into the same snippet without changing how you load it.

**Usage:**

```bash
kin shell-init <bash|zsh|fish> [--no-completions]
```

Load it once from your shell config:

```bash
# bash / zsh (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc)
eval "$(kin shell-init zsh)"
```

```fish
# fish (~/.config/fish/config.fish)
kin shell-init fish | source
```

The snippet does two things:

- Registers Kindra's dynamic shell completions (the same output as `kin completions <shell>`).
- Shadows `kin` with a function that special-cases `kin wt cd` — capturing the path the binary prints and running `cd` — and forwards every other invocation unchanged to the real binary via `command kin`.

It emits static text and does not require being inside a repository, so it is safe to load unconditionally.

- `--no-completions`: Emit only the `cd` wrapper, for users who install completions separately (e.g. via a package). The standalone `kin completions <shell>` command remains available either way.

**When to use it:** Add it to your shell config once to get completions and make `kin wt cd <target>` actually change directory instead of just printing the path.

### `push`

**Description:** Pushes all branches in the current stack to their respective upstreams.

**Usage:**

```bash
kin push
kin push --allow-base-push <branch>
```

**Options:**

- `--allow-base-push <BRANCH>`: Allow `<BRANCH>` to push onto the base branch it tracks. Repeatable; each branch must be named explicitly.

This command performs an atomic push of all branches in the stack using `force-with-lease` to ensure safety.

**Pushing onto a base branch is refused.** If a branch's upstream is a base branch — `main`, `master`, `trunk`, `init.defaultBranch`, or the stack's configured base — then its push destination is that base, and pushing would force-update it with the branch's history. This happens by default in git: with `branch.autoSetupMerge=true`, `git switch -c feature origin/main` sets `branch.feature.merge = refs/heads/main`. `kin push` refuses, names the mapping, and offers to repoint the branch at its own remote branch.

To do it deliberately anyway — say you maintain a fork's `main` from a local branch — name the branch: `kin push --allow-base-push mirror`, or set it once with `git config branch.mirror.kinAllowBasePush true`. The override is per-branch by design: it cannot be applied to a whole stack at once, `--yes` does not imply it, and every overridden mapping is labelled in the push output. Git's own `--force-with-lease` still applies.

**When to use it:** Use this when you've updated multiple branches in your stack (e.g., after a `kin commit` or `kin move`) and want to sync them all to the remote in one go.

---

### `run`

**Description:** Runs a shell command on each branch in the stack, starting from the base and moving toward the tips.

**Usage:**

```bash
kin run -c <command>
kin run --command <command>
kin run --continue-on-failure --command <command>
```

**Arguments:**
- `-c, --command <command>`: The shell command to run on each branch. Required.
- `--continue-on-failure`: If the command fails on a branch, continue to the next branch instead of stopping. By default, the command stops on the first failure.

**What it does:**
- Discovers stack branches from the current HEAD using the same logic as other Kindra commands.
- Sorts branches topologically from base to tips.
- For each branch:
  - Prints a header `=== Running on <branch> ===`
  - Checks out the branch
  - Executes the command via `sh -c`
  - Prints stdout and stderr
- Returns to the original branch when done.
- Prints a summary showing success/failure counts and any failed branches.

**When to use it:** Use this to run tests, linters, builds, or any other commands across all branches in your stack. For example, running `cargo test` on each branch to verify tests pass before creating PRs.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Run tests on all branches
kin run -c "cargo test"

# Run linter with continue-on-failure to see all results
kin run --continue-on-failure -c "cargo clippy"

# Run a custom command
kin run -c "echo 'Hello from $(git branch --show-current)'"
```

---

### `pr`

**Description:** Manages pull requests for branches in the current stack.

**Usage:**

```bash
kin pr [--no-push] [--all]
kin pr open
kin pr edit
kin pr flatten
kin pr merge
kin pr status
kin pr review [--output <path>] [--copy] [--no-outdated] [--resolved] [--reviewer <login>] [--bots|--no-bots]
```

- `kin pr`: Create/update PRs for stack branches with upstreams, skipping open PRs authored by other GitHub users. By default it first checks whether open PR bases on GitHub still match the local stack order, flattens them to the resolved upstream base if needed, and pushes before running normal PR creation/update logic.
- `kin pr --no-push`: Skip that automatic flatten/push preflight and use the previous create/update behavior.
- `kin pr --all`: Include stack PRs authored by other GitHub users in push, base update, and stack-section updates.
- `kin pr open`: Open a PR URL in the default browser (if multiple, choose one).
- `kin pr edit`: Select a PR (if multiple), then edit title/body/labels/reviewers.
- `kin pr flatten`: Retarget every open PR in the current stack to the resolved upstream base branch on GitHub (for example, `origin/main` normalizes to `main`).
- `kin pr merge`: Select an open PR in the current stack and merge it only when review/check state is ready, or prompt/error with the blocking reasons.
- `kin pr status`: Show each stack PR's reviewer status, unresolved comments, and running/failed checks. It also reports any interrupted `kin commit`, `kin move`, `kin reorder`, `kin sync`, or `kin restack` operation in the current repo and points you to `kin continue`/`kin abort` or native Git rebase commands when there is no saved Kindra state.
- `kin pr review`: Select an open PR in the current stack, fetch its review threads through `gh api graphql`, and render them as markdown.

`kin pr merge` automatically merges when the PR has no unresolved review comments, no outstanding review state, no running/failed checks, and GitHub reports the PR as mergeable. If issues remain but GitHub would still allow merging, Kindra prints the outstanding reviews/checks and asks for confirmation. If GitHub/repository rules block the merge, Kindra exits with a clear reason instead of attempting it.

`kin pr flatten` only updates PR base branches on GitHub. It does not modify local git refs, stack relationships, PR titles, or PR bodies.

`kin pr review` defaults to unresolved threads only, includes both human and bot comments, and keeps outdated comments unless you opt out.

**Arguments:**

- `-o, --output <path>`: Write the rendered markdown to a file.
- `--copy`: Copy the rendered markdown to the terminal clipboard using OSC 52.
- `--no-outdated`: Exclude outdated review threads.
- `--resolved`: Include resolved review threads.
- `--reviewer <login>`: Only include comments authored by the specified reviewer/login.
- `--bots`: Explicitly include bot comments/replies (this is the default).
- `--no-bots`: Restrict output to human-authored comments/replies.

**Formatting details:**

- Each top-level review thread is rendered as markdown with the file path and line number above the comment body.
- Replies are shown beneath the original comment in chronological order with one blank line between entries.
- Top-level review threads are separated by two blank lines.
- Outdated threads are labeled `OUTDATED` and include the original comment line number when rendered.

**Notes:**

- These commands require authenticated GitHub CLI (`gh auth status` must succeed).
- Both `kin status` and `kin pr status` report interrupted `kin commit`, `kin move`, `kin reorder`, `kin sync`, and `kin restack` operations.
- When a saved Kindra state exists, continue with `kin continue` or clean up with `kin abort`. If there is no saved Kindra state and Git itself is mid-rebase, use `git rebase --continue` or `git rebase --abort`.

### `split`

**Description:** Opens your `$EDITOR` to visually manage branch assignments for a series of commits.

**Usage:**

```bash
kin split
```

It generates a list of commits and branches. You can move the `branch <name>` lines to reassign branches to different commits, or add/remove them to create/delete branches. Leaving a row's name blank (a bare `branch` line) auto-names the branch by slugifying the summary of the commit it sits on, deduped against existing branches.

**When to use it:** Use this when you've made a long series of commits on a single branch and want to "split" them into multiple separate, dependent branches for easier review.

**ASCII-Art Visualization:**

```text
Before split (one branch, multiple commits):
main -> [C1] -> [C2] -> [C3] -> (my-feature)

$ kin split
# In $EDITOR (the bare "branch" row under C2 is auto-named from its summary):
[C1] Initial work
branch feature-part-1
[C2] More work
branch
[C3] Final work
branch my-feature

After split:
main -> [C1] -> (feature-part-1) -> [C2] -> (more-work) -> [C3] -> (my-feature)
```

---

### Status & Control

If a `kin commit`, `kin move`, `kin reorder`, `kin sync`, or `kin restack` operation is interrupted (e.g., due to a merge conflict), both `kin status` and `kin pr status` report the interrupted operation and how to recover:

- **`kin status`**: Shows the current state of the interrupted operation, including which branch is currently being rebased and which ones are remaining.
- **`kin continue`**: Resumes the operation after you've resolved conflicts. It handles the underlying `git rebase --continue` and then proceeds with the remaining branches in the stack.
- **`kin abort`**: Cancels the current operation and cleans up the state.
- If there is no saved Kindra state and Git itself is in the middle of a native rebase, use `git rebase --continue` or `git rebase --abort`.

---

### Undo & History

Kindra records every stack-rewriting operation — `sync`, `reorder`, `move`, `restack`, and `split` — in an operation log, so a bad reorder or an unexpected sync result is a single command away from being reversed rather than a manual `git reflog` archaeology session.

Each recorded operation stores the tip of every affected branch both before and after it ran. Those commits are anchored as ordinary refs under `refs/kindra/undo/`, which keeps them alive against `git gc` even after a branch is deleted or rebased away. The log keeps the most recent operations and is safe to delete at any time — it stores only recovery information, never anything the stacks depend on.

- **`kin undo`**: Reverts the most recent recorded operation, restoring every affected branch to its previous tip and returning `HEAD` to where it was. Run it again to step further back through history.
- **`kin redo`**: Reapplies the most recently undone operation. Running any new stack-rewriting operation clears the redo history (the standard editor undo-stack behavior).
- **`kin reflog`** (alias `kin oplog`): Lists recent operations, newest first, marking the current position (`*`) and any undone operations that can be redone (`↑`).

**Safety:**

- `undo`/`redo` refuse to run if a branch has changed since the operation was recorded, or if the working tree has uncommitted changes, so your work is never silently discarded. Pass `--force` to override either check.
- Aborting an in-progress operation with `kin abort` usually records nothing, because the abort restores the pre-operation refs. The exception is when the repository has diverged from Kindra's saved state so those refs cannot be cleanly restored: `kin abort` then clears the state but leaves the operation's effects in place, recording an undo entry so `kin undo` can still reverse them.
- A branch deleted by `kin sync` prints its old commit SHA, and `kin undo` can recreate it.

**Usage:**

```bash
# Rebased the stack with kin sync but didn't like the result:
kin undo

# Changed your mind:
kin redo

# See what happened recently:
kin reflog
```

**Example:**

```text
$ kin sync
$ kin reflog
Kindra operation log (newest first):
* 3s ago  sync     feature-a, feature-b rebased

$ kin undo
Undid sync: feature-a, feature-b rebased
Run 'kin redo' to reapply it.
```

**What is not tracked:** `kin commit` and `kin run` are not recorded, because `commit` creates ordinary commits recoverable with `git reset`/`git reflog`, and `run` executes your own commands. Their effects are still visible in Git's native reflog.

---

### Shell Completions

**Description:** Generates shell completion scripts for various shells. Bash, zsh, fish, PowerShell, and Elvish completions call back into `kin` as you type, so branch-aware flags such as `kin commit --on <branch>` and `kin move --onto <branch>` complete local branch names from the current repository.

**Usage:**

```bash
kin completions <shell>
```

Supported shells: `bash`, `zsh`, `fish`, `powershell`, `elvish`, `nu`.

**Installation Example (Zsh):**

```bash
source <(kin completions zsh)
```

Add that line to `~/.zshrc` to enable completions for new shells.

**Installation Example (Bash):**

```bash
source <(kin completions bash)
```

Add that line to `~/.bashrc` to enable completions for new shells.

**Installation Example (Fish):**

```fish
kin completions fish | source
```

Add that line to `~/.config/fish/config.fish` to enable completions for new shells.
