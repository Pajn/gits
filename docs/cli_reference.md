## Core Concepts

`gits` is built around the idea of a **stack** of branches. A stack is a linear sequence of branches where each branch builds on top of the previous one, ultimately originating from a "base" branch (like `main` or `master`).

`gits` automatically identifies your stack by looking for local branches that are descendants of the merge base between your current branch and the base branch.

---

## Command Reference

### `commit`

**Description:** Commits changes to the current branch and automatically rebases all descendant branches in the stack.

**Usage:**
```bash
gits commit [git-commit-args]
```
Any arguments you pass to `gits commit` (e.g., `-m "my message"`) are passed directly to `git commit`.

**When to use it:** Use this instead of `git commit` when you are working on a branch that has other branches building on top of it. It saves you from having to manually rebase each dependent branch.

**ASCII-Art Visualization:**
```text
Before commit on 'feature-A':
main -> [A1] -> (feature-A) -> [B1] -> (feature-B) -> [C1] -> (feature-C)

$ gits commit -m "update A"

After gits commit:
main -> [A1] -> [A2] -> (feature-A) -> [B1'] -> (feature-B) -> [C1'] -> (feature-C)
```
*(All descendant branches `feature-B` and `feature-C` are updated automatically.)*

---

### `move`

**Description:** Moves the current branch and all its descendants onto a new target branch.

**Usage:**
```bash
gits move [--onto <target>] [--all]
```
- `--onto <target>`: The branch to move the current stack onto.
- `--all`: If no target is specified, list all local branches to choose from (instead of just branches in the current stack).

**When to use it:** Use this when you want to relocate a whole set of changes to a new base branch (e.g., moving a feature stack from `develop` to `main`).

**ASCII-Art Visualization:**
```text
Before moving 'feature-A' onto 'main':
main -> [M1]
      \-> [D1] -> (develop) -> [A1] -> (feature-A) -> [B1] -> (feature-B)

$ gits move --onto main

After gits move:
main -> [M1] -> [A1'] -> (feature-A) -> [B1'] -> (feature-B)
      \-> [D1] -> (develop)
```

---

### `checkout` (alias `co`)

**Description:** Provides an interactive interface to navigate branches in the stack.

**Usage:**
```bash
gits checkout [--all]
gits checkout [subcommand]
```
- `gits co`: Opens an interactive selection menu for branches in the current stack.
- `gits co --all`: Opens an interactive selection menu for all local branches.
- `gits co up`: Checkout the branch immediately "above" the current one in the stack.
- `gits co down`: Checkout the branch immediately "below" the current one in the stack.
- `gits co top`: Checkout the branch at the very top of the current stack.

**When to use it:** Use this for fast, ergonomic navigation without needing to remember branch names.

---

### `push`

**Description:** Pushes all branches in the current stack to their respective upstreams.

**Usage:**
```bash
gits push
```
This command performs an atomic push of all branches in the stack using `force-with-lease` to ensure safety.

**When to use it:** Use this when you've updated multiple branches in your stack (e.g., after a `gits commit` or `gits move`) and want to sync them all to the remote in one go.

---

### `split`

**Description:** Opens your `$EDITOR` to visually manage branch assignments for a series of commits.

**Usage:**
```bash
gits split
```
It generates a list of commits and branches. You can move the `branch <name>` lines to reassign branches to different commits, or add/remove them to create/delete branches.

**When to use it:** Use this when you've made a long series of commits on a single branch and want to "split" them into multiple separate, dependent branches for easier review.

**ASCII-Art Visualization:**
```text
Before split (one branch, multiple commits):
main -> [C1] -> [C2] -> [C3] -> (my-feature)

$ gits split
# In $EDITOR:
[C1] Initial work
branch feature-part-1
[C2] More work
branch feature-part-2
[C3] Final work
branch my-feature

After split:
main -> [C1] -> (feature-part-1) -> [C2] -> (feature-part-2) -> [C3] -> (my-feature)
```

---

### Status & Control

If a `gits commit` or `gits move` operation is interrupted (e.g., due to a merge conflict), use these commands to manage it:

- **`gits status`**: Shows the current state of an in-progress operation, including which branch is currently being rebased and which ones are remaining.
- **`gits continue`**: Resumes the operation after you've resolved conflicts (runs `git rebase --continue` internally).
- **`gits abort`**: Cancels the current operation and cleans up the state.

---

### Shell Completions

**Description:** Generates shell completion scripts for various shells.

**Usage:**
```bash
gits completions <shell>
```
Supported shells: `bash`, `zsh`, `fish`, `powershell`, `elvish`, `nu`.

**Installation Example (Zsh):**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.zsh/completions
gits completions zsh > ~/.zsh/completions/_gits
fpath=(~/.zsh/completions $fpath)
autoload -Uz compinit && compinit
```
